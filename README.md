Description:
DerDieDasGame is a software program for memorizing the grammatical gender (and respective articles) of some basic words in German.
In German there is no general rule about the grammatical genders of the nouns, thus the gender of every word has to be learned by heart. The game helps to make it convenient and more fun.
The learner has to choose the correct article for the noun that is displayed on the screen. If he/she chose the correct article, a new word appears. If the learner clicked on the wrong article, then he/she can click again.  At the end of the game the game provides feedback: the percentage of the correct answers, including only those items that were answered correctly with the first click, will be shown.

Requirements:
1. Java SE Development Kit 8
2. IntelliJ JAVA IDE, download link: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/  Works on both versions (also community edition)
